They tell you where the Boss is about to drop obstacles, so you can avoid them. The second part of the boss battle is easy. Don’t worry about when or where you’re tapping – just tap and do it fast! As long as you keep tapping, you’ll slap the Boss about and free your friend from the cage. Just like a true hero!\n\n",
